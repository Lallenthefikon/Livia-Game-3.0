This is a lovely place, don’t you think? Even the walls are... sticky!
The good thing about that, though, is that I can help you climb them.
Go on, try jumping over that wall!

Mansasoul: Amazing! You’ll do great!

Livia: So what’s our mission? How do we defeat Mhuinín?

Livia: Who’s Tummy AcidTrip?

Mansasoul: THAT’S Tummy AcidTrip! RUUN!!

Mansasoul: Phew! That was close. I think we’re safe here.
