MAa
Livia! You're finally here! 
 
 
LIa
Huh? Who are you?
 
 
MAb
I'm your Mansa Soul, of course! I'm so glad you're here,
I've had such a hard time. The other souls are a pain in the..
*giggles*, not letting me do my job.
LIb
I know, that's why I'm here.
 
 
MAc
That's good! But seriously, they're actually evil!
They want to control you.
 
LIc
They're evil? I just thought they were annoying!
 
 
MAd
Well, you're not wrong. But mostly they're evil. 
Maybe we could help each other? I can show you the way to the souls, 
and we can fight them together.
LId
Sounds good! You can be like my side-kick!
 
 
MAe
Well, maybe we can discuss that… 
But first let's get further in! I can show you around.
