Mansasoul: Livia! You’re finally here! 

Livia: Huh? Who are you?

Mansasoul: I’m your Mansa Soul, of course! I’m so glad you’re here,
I’ve had such a hard time. The other souls are a pain in the..
*giggles*, not letting me do my job. 

Livia: I know, that’s why I’m here.

Mansasoul: That’s good! But seriously, they’re actually evil.
They want to control you.

Livia: They’re evil? I just thought they were annoying!

Mansasoul: Well, you’re not wrong. But mostly they’re evil.
Maybe we could help each other?  
I can show you the way to the souls, and we can fight them together.

Livia: Sounds good! You can be like my side-kick!

Mansasoul: Well, maybe we can discuss that… 
But first let’s get further in! I can show you around.
